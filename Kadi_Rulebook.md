# Kadi: The Consolidated Rulebook

## 1. Introduction

**Kadi** (also known as *Niko Kadi*) is a popular and fast-paced Kenyan social card game. While casually compared to "local poker," its gameplay mechanics are more similar to shedding-style games like Uno or Mau-Mau. It is played informally among friends and family, and its rules have been developed organically by players over time.

The game's appeal comes from its blend of simple rules, deep strategy, and high social interaction.

### Objective
The primary objective is to be the first player to legally play all the cards from your hand.

## 2. Equipment

*   **Deck:** A standard 52-card deck. Two Jokers may be added for a 54-card deck, where they act as powerful penalty cards.
*   **Players:** Typically 2 to 5 players.

## 3. Card Roles & Classifications

Understanding the role of each card is critical to Kadi strategy.

| Category          | Cards                             | Function                                                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Answer Cards**  | 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10                 | Standard playable cards. These are the only cards that can be used to win the game. |
| **Question Cards**| Queen (Q), 8                      | Requires the next player to "answer" with a matching suit or another Question Card. |
| **Jump Card**     | Jack (J)                          | Skips the next player's turn.                                             |
| **Kickback Card** | King (K)                          | Reverses the direction of play.                                           |
| **Control Card**  | Ace (A)                           | Allows the player to change the active suit; can also cancel penalties.   |
| **Penalty Cards** | 2, 3, Joker                       | Forces the next player to draw a number of cards (2, 3, or 5+ respectively). |

## 4. Game Setup

1.  **Dealing:** One player is chosen as the dealer. The dealer shuffles the deck and deals 3 or 4 cards to each player.
2.  **Draw Pile:** The remaining cards are placed face-down to form the draw pile.
3.  **Discard Pile:** The top card of the draw pile is turned face-up to start the discard pile.
    *   **Important:** The starting card cannot be a special card (any card other than an Answer Card). If a special card is drawn, it is returned to the middle of the draw pile, and a new card is drawn until an Answer Card (4-10) is revealed.

## 5. Core Gameplay

### Match and Play
On your turn, you must play a card from your hand that matches either the **suit** or the **rank** of the top card on the discard pile.

### Drawing Cards
If you cannot play a legal card, you must draw one card from the top of the draw pile. If you can play the card you just drew, you may do so immediately. Otherwise, your turn ends.

### Multi-Card Play
A key feature of Kadi is playing multiple cards in a single turn.

*   You may play multiple cards of the **same rank** together (e.g., three 7s).
This is a powerful move to shed cards quickly and is essential for advanced strategy and winning the game.

## 6. Special Card Actions

*   **Question Cards (Queen or 8):**
    When a Q or 8 is played, the next player must "answer" by playing a card of the same suit. If they cannot, they must draw one card and their turn is forfeited. Multiple Question Cards can be stacked.

*   **Jump Card (Jack):**
    Playing a Jack skips the next player in sequence. Multiple Jacks can be stacked to skip multiple players.

*   **Kickback Card (King):**
    Playing a King reverses the direction of play. If played in a two-player game, it acts as a skip. Multiple Kings can be stacked, reversing the direction with each play.

*   **Control Card (Ace):**
    The Ace is the most powerful strategic card. When played, you can declare a new suit that the next player must follow. It can also be used in some house rules to cancel a penalty card.

*   **Penalty Cards (2, 3, Joker):**
    When a penalty card is played, the next player must draw the specified number of cards and their turn is skipped.
    *   **2:** Draw 2 cards.
    *   **3:** Draw 3 cards.
    *   **Joker:** Draw 5 cards (or more, by house rule).
    The penalty can be "passed on" or "forwarded" if the next player also plays a penalty card. The total number of cards to be drawn then accumulates for the following player.

## 7. Winning the Game

Winning in Kadi is a two-step process that requires a strategic declaration.

### 1. The "Niko Kadi!" Declaration
You must declare "Niko Kadi!" out loud at the end of the turn in which you become able to win on your *next* turn.
*   **Declaring too early** makes you a target for penalties, skips, and reversals.
*   **Declaring too late (or not at all)** invalidates your win. If you play your last card without having declared, you are penalized (usually by drawing cards) and must continue playing.

### 2. The Final Move
To legally win the game, your final move must adhere to these rules:
*   You must play all of your remaining cards in a single, legal move. This is often done with a multi-card play (e.g., two 9s).
*   Your final card(s) **must be Answer Cards** (4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10). You cannot win by playing a special card as your last move.

## 8. Advanced Strategy

*   **Hand Management:** Maintain a balance of suits in your hand to avoid getting stuck. Track which suits have been heavily played.
*   **Concealment:** Avoid revealing the strength of your hand. Occasionally drawing a card even when you can play can mislead opponents.
*   **The Ace is Your Trump Card:** Save your Ace. Use it late in thegame to break penalty chains, force an opponent into a weak suit, or set up your winning move.
*   **Endgame Focus:** The game is often won or lost in the last few turns. Conserve your power cards (especially Aces and Jacks) for the endgame to control the flow and stop opponents from winning.

## 9. Variations & House Rules

Kadi is defined by its unwritten, flexible rules. Always clarify house rules with your group before playing. Common variations include:
*   **Jokers:** Whether they are used and how many cards they force a player to draw.
*   **Penalty Stacking:** How penalties accumulate and whether an Ace can cancel them.
*   **Finishing Moves:** Permitted final cards can vary.

## 10. Glossary

*   **Answer Card:** A "normal" playing card (4-10) used to win.
*   **Feeding:** The act of playing a penalty card.
*   **Jump / Skip:** The action of a Jack card.
*   **Kickback / Reverse:** The action of a King card.
*   **Niko Kadi!:** The mandatory declaration that a player is one move away from winning.
